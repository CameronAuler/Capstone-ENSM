# ENSM
The official repository for the Enhanced Network Security Monitoring Project. Network security combined with deep learning AI for threat detection and network analysis.

The ENSM project was started in order to integrate artificial intelligence into a network monitoring and threat detection tool giving the SOC team or network admin the resources they need to efficiently and effectively keep their network secure. The primary use of this AI will be to analyze each log entry from every system on the network and determine if there is a potential security threat.

ENSM will be using Python 3 complemented by React and FastAPI for the user interface and Tensorflow configured with Kera for the artificial intelligence aspect of the project. When selecting the tools we will be using for the UI, we chose React because it provides maximum customizability for interface design and it is compatible with many different platforms providing future opportunities to expand platforms. For the sake of simplicity, we chose Tensorflow because while it is a less complex and customizable utility it is user-friendly which will be helpful for our first AI project.
