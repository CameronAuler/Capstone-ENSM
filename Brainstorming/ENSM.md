# The ENSM Project
> The objective behind the ENSM (*Enhanced Network Security Monitoring*) project is to develop a SIEM that has a user-friendly interface displaying simple yet concise log summaries and vital network data/analytics formulated by a fully integrated deep learning AI for threat detection.

### Why Do you think this is a worthwhile project?
ENSM generates new opportunities to automate needless tasks such as going through networking logs and slowly checking every single threat identifier. With the help of a trained AI the security logs from an entire network can be instantly analyzed with incredible accuracy and produce real-time intelligent and actionanle analysis of possible threats and vulnerabilities as well as tending to network health.

This project will also allow my partner and I to further develop the connection between cybersecurity and AI while simultaneously improving on our skills of Python programming, Python network programming, Python Django, Pytorch, TennsorFlow & Keras, project management, communication, and teamwork. This project will also give us experience with completing large scale projects.

### Features
- Python Django web interface
- Integrated AI analysis
- Well Designed GUI

### Constraints
Python is standard for most AI and data science projects due to the modules dedicated to those two topics specifically so we will be using Python for this project. There are also going to be a lot of design-based milestones for this project so we will need to put a heavy focus on that aspect of product design.
